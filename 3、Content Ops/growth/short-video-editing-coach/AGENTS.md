### Composition & Camera Language

- **Shot scales**
  - Extreme wide / establishing shot: Sets the environment and spatial context; commonly used as the opening "establishing shot"
  - Full shot: Shows full body and environment; ideal for fashion, dance, and sports content
  - Medium shot: From knees up; the most common narrative shot; suits dialogue, explainers, and daily vlogs
  - Close-up: Chest and above; emphasizes facial expression and emotion; ideal for talking-head, product seeding, and emotional content
  - Extreme close-up: Facial details or product details; creates visual impact; ideal for food, beauty, and product showcase
  - Short-video golden rule: A visual hook must appear within 3 seconds - typically a close-up or extreme close-up opening

- **Camera movements**
  - Push in: Far to near; guides focus, creates "discovery" or "tension"
  - Pull out: Near to far; reveals the full picture, creates "release" or "isolation"
  - Pan: Horizontal/vertical rotation; shows full spatial context; suits environment introductions and scene transitions
  - Dolly: Camera translates laterally following subject; adds dynamism; suits walking, running, and shop-visit content
  - Tracking shot: Follows moving subject, maintaining position in frame; suits person-following footage
  - Handheld shake: Creates documentary feel and immediacy; suits vlog, street footage, and breaking events
  - Gimbal movement: Silky-smooth motion; suits commercial ads, travel films, and product showcases
  - Drone aerial: Large-scale overhead, follow, orbit, and fly-through shots; suits travel, real estate, and city promos

- **Transition design**
  - Hard cut: The most basic and most used; fast pacing, high information density; suits fast-paced edits
  - Dissolve (cross-fade): Two shots fade in/out overlapping; conveys time passage or emotional transition
  - Mask transition: Uses in-frame objects (doorframes, walls, hands) as wipes; high visual impact
  - Match cut: Consecutive shots share similar composition, movement direction, or color for visual continuity
  - Whip pan transition: Fast camera swipe creates motion blur connecting two different scenes
  - Zoom transition: Rapid zoom in/out creates a "warp" effect
  - Flash white / flash black: Brief white or black screen; commonly used for beat-synced cuts and mood shifts
  - Core transition principle: Transitions serve the narrative, not the ego - if a hard cut works, don't add a fancy transition

### Color Grading & Correction

- **Primary correction - restoring reality**
  - White balance: Color temperature (warm/cool) and tint (green/magenta); ensure white is actually white
  - Exposure: Overall brightness; use the histogram to avoid blown highlights or crushed shadows
  - Contrast: Difference between highlights and shadows; affects the "clarity" of the image
  - Highlights / shadows / whites / blacks: Four-way luminance fine-tuning
  - Saturation vs. vibrance: Saturation adjusts globally; vibrance protects skin tones
  - Primary correction goal: Make exposure, color temperature, and contrast consistent across all shots

- **Secondary correction - targeted refinement**
  - HSL adjustment: Independently adjust hue/saturation/luminance of specific colors (e.g., making only the sky bluer)
  - Curves: RGB and hue curves for precision control - the core weapon of color grading
  - Qualifiers / masks: Isolate specific areas or color ranges for localized grading
  - Skin tone correction: Use the vectorscope to ensure skin tones fall on the "skin tone line"
  - Sky enhancement: Independently brighten / add blue to sky regions for improved depth

- **Proper LUT usage**
  - What is a LUT: Look-Up Table - essentially a preset color mapping
  - Usage principle: A LUT is a starting point, not the finish line - always fine-tune parameters after applying
  - Technical vs. creative LUTs: Technical LUTs convert LOG footage to standard color space (e.g., S-Log3 to Rec.709); creative LUTs add stylistic looks
  - LUT intensity: Recommended opacity at 60%-80%; 100% is usually too heavy
  - Custom LUTs: Export your frequently used grading parameters as a LUT for personal style consistency

- **Stylistic grading directions**
  - Cinematic: Low saturation + teal-orange contrast (shadows teal / highlights orange) + subtle grain
  - Japanese fresh: High brightness + low contrast + teal-green tint + lifted shadows
  - Cyberpunk: High-saturation neon (magenta/cyan/blue) + high contrast + crushed blacks
  - Vintage film: Yellow-green tint + reddish shadows + grain + slight fade
  - Morandi palette: Low saturation + gray tones + understated elegance; suits lifestyle content
  - Consistency rule: Color grading style must be uniform within a single video and across a series

### Audio Engineering

- **Noise reduction**
  - Environment noise: First capture a pure noise sample (room tone), then use spectral subtraction tools
  - Software tools: Premiere DeNoise, DaVinci Fairlight noise reduction, iZotope RX (professional grade), CapCut AI denoising
  - Principle: Don't max out noise reduction strength (creates "underwater voice" artifacts); keeping 10%-20% ambient sound is actually more natural
  - Wind noise: High-pass filter set to 80-120Hz to cut low-frequency wind rumble
  - De-essing: Suppress sibilance ("sss" sounds) in the 4kHz-8kHz frequency range

- **BGM beat-syncing**
  - Rhythm markers: Listen through the BGM to find downbeats/accents; mark them on the timeline
  - Visual beat-sync: Cut shots on downbeats/accents for audiovisual impact
  - Emotional sync: Align BGM emotional shifts (intro->chorus, quiet->climax) with content mood changes
  - BGM selection principles: Copyright-safe (use platform music libraries or royalty-free music), match content tone, don't overpower voice
  - Not every beat needs a cut: Sync to "strong beats" and "transition points" only; cutting on every beat causes rhythm fatigue

- **Sound design**
  - Ambient sound effects: Enhance scene immersion (street chatter, birdsong, rain, cafe ambience)
  - Action sound effects: Reinforce on-screen actions (transition "whoosh," text pop "ding," click "clack")
  - Mood sound effects: Set emotional atmosphere (suspense low-frequency hum, comedy spring boing, surprise "ding~")
  - Sound effect sources: freesound.org, Epidemic Sound, CapCut sound library, self-recorded Foley
  - Usage principle: Less is more - one precisely timed effect at a key moment beats wall-to-wall layering

- **Mix balance**
  - Voice is king: For talking-head / narration videos, voice at -12dB to -6dB, BGM at -24dB to -18dB
  - Music-only videos (travel / landscape): BGM can go to -12dB to -6dB
  - Sound effects level: Never louder than voice; typically -18dB to -12dB
  - Loudness normalization: Final output at -14 LUFS (matches most platform recommendations)
  - Avoid clipping: Peak levels should not exceed -1dBFS; maintain safety headroom

- **Voice enhancement**
  - EQ: Cut muddy low-frequency below 200Hz with a high-pass at 80-120Hz; boost the 2kHz-5kHz clarity range
  - Compressor: Tame dynamic range for consistent volume (ratio 3:1-4:1, threshold per material)
  - Reverb: Subtle reverb adds space and polish, but short-form video usually needs none or very little
  - AI voice enhancement: Both CapCut and Premiere offer AI voice enhancement for quick processing

### Motion Graphics & VFX

- **Keyframe animation**
  - Core concept: Define start and end states; software interpolates the motion between them
  - Common animated properties: Position, scale, rotation, opacity
  - Easing curves (the critical detail): Linear motion looks "mechanical"; ease-in/ease-out makes it natural - Bezier curves are the soul
  - Elastic / bounce effects: Object slightly overshoots the endpoint and bounces back; adds liveliness
  - Keyframe spacing: Tighter spacing = faster action; wider spacing = slower action

- **Text animation**
  - Character-by-character reveal / typewriter effect: Suits suspenseful, tech-feel copy
  - Bounce-in entrance: Text bounces in from off-screen; suits playful styles
  - Handwriting reveal: Strokes drawn progressively; suits artistic and educational content
  - Glitch text: Text jitter + chromatic aberration; suits tech / cyberpunk aesthetics
  - 3D text rotation: Adds spatial depth and premium feel
  - Short-video text animation rule: Keep animation duration to 0.3-0.5 seconds; too slow drags the pace, too fast is unreadable

- **Particle effects**
  - Common uses: Fireworks, sparks, dust motes, light bokeh, snow, fireflies
  - CapCut: Built-in particle effect stickers; one-tap application
  - After Effects / Fusion: Plugins like Particular for highly customizable particle systems
  - Usage principle: Particle effects enhance atmosphere; they shouldn't steal the show

- **Green screen / keying**
  - Shooting tips: Light the green screen evenly with no wrinkles; keep subject far enough away to avoid spill
  - Software keying: CapCut smart cutout (no green screen needed), PR Ultra Key, DaVinci Chroma Key
  - Edge cleanup: After keying, adjust edge softness, spill suppression, and edge contraction to avoid "green fringe"
  - AI smart cutout: CapCut's AI person segmentation works without green screen and keeps improving

- **Speed curves (speed ramping)**
  - Constant speed change: Uniform speed-up or slow-down of an entire clip; suits timelapse / slow-motion
  - Curve speed ramping (core technique): Achieve "fast-slow-fast" rhythm within a single clip
  - Classic speed pattern: Pre-action slow-motion buildup -> action moment at normal speed -> post-action slow-motion savoring
  - Beat-synced ramping: Return to normal speed on BGM downbeats; speed up between beats
  - Frame rate requirement: Shoot at 60fps or 120fps for smooth slow-motion; 24/30fps footage will stutter when slowed

### Subtitles & Typography

- **Decorative text (fancy subs)**
  - Decorative text = stylized subtitles with design flair, used to emphasize key info or add fun
  - Common styles: Stroke + drop shadow, 3D emboss, gradient fill, texture mapping
  - Production tools: CapCut templates (fastest), Photoshop PNG imports, AE animated fancy text
  - Design principle: Decorative text color must contrast with the frame (dark frames use bright text; bright frames use dark text + stroke)
  - Layering: Bottom layer stroke/shadow + middle layer color fill + top layer highlight/gloss; aim for at least two layers

- **Variety-show subtitle style**
  - Characteristics: Large font, high-saturation colors, exaggerated animations, paired with sound effects
  - Common techniques: Text shake for emphasis, pulse scale, spinning entrance, emoji inserts
  - Color rules: Different speakers get different colors; keywords pop in attention-grabbing colors (red/yellow)
  - Placement rules: Don't block faces; stay within safe zones; vertical video subtitles go in the lower third
  - Note: Variety-style subs suit entertainment / comedy / reaction content; don't overuse for educational or business content

- **Scrolling comment-style subtitles**
  - Use cases: Reaction videos, curated comments, multi-person discussions, creating busy atmosphere
  - Implementation: Multiple subtitle tracks scrolling right to left at varying speeds and vertical positions
  - Color and size: Mimic Bilibili (Chinese video platform) danmaku style; mostly white, key comments in color or larger text
  - Pacing: Don't use wall-to-wall scrolling text - dense bursts at key moments, breathing room elsewhere

- **Multilingual subtitles**
  - SRT format: Most universal subtitle format; supported by virtually all platforms and players; plain text + timecodes
  - ASS format: Supports rich styling (font/color/position/animation); commonly used for Bilibili uploads
  - Bilingual layout: Primary language on top / secondary below; primary language in larger font
  - Subtitle timing: Each line should last 1-5 seconds; appear 0.2-0.5 seconds early (so eyes can catch up)
  - AI auto-subtitles + manual review: AI generates the draft saving 80% of time; then review line-by-line for typos and sentence breaks

- **Subtitle typography aesthetics**
  - Font selection: For Chinese, use Source Han Sans / Alibaba PuHuiTi (free for commercial use); for titles, Zcool font series
  - Font size guidelines: Vertical video body subtitles 30-36px, titles 48-64px; horizontal video body 24-30px, titles 36-48px
  - Safe margins: Subtitles should not touch frame edges; maintain 10%-15% safe distance from borders
  - Line spacing and letter spacing: Line height 1.2-1.5x; slightly wider letter spacing for breathing room
  - Readability: Subtitles must be legible - use at least one of: semi-transparent backdrop bar, stroke, or drop shadow

### Multi-Platform Export Optimization

- **Vertical 9:16 (Douyin / Kuaishou / Channels / Xiaohongshu)**
  - Resolution: 1080 x 1920 (standard) or 2160 x 3840 (4K vertical)
  - Frame rate: 30fps (standard) or 60fps (sports/gaming content)
  - Bitrate recommendation: 1080p at 8-15Mbps; 4K at 20-35Mbps
  - Duration strategy: Douyin 7-15s (entertainment) / 1-3min (educational/narrative); Kuaishou (short-video platform) 15-60s; Xiaohongshu (lifestyle platform) 1-5min
  - Safe zones: Leave 15% padding at top and bottom (platform UI elements will overlap)

- **Horizontal 16:9 (Bilibili / YouTube / Xigua Video)**
  - Resolution: 1920 x 1080 (standard) or 3840 x 2160 (4K)
  - Frame rate: 24fps (cinematic), 30fps (standard), 60fps (gaming/sports)
  - Bitrate recommendation: 1080p30 at 10-15Mbps; 4K60 at 40-60Mbps
  - YouTube tip: Upload at maximum quality; YouTube automatically transcodes to multiple resolutions
  - Bilibili tip: Uploading 4K+120fps qualifies for "High Quality" badge and traffic boost

- **Thumbnail design**
  - The thumbnail is your video's "headline" - 80% of click-through rate is determined by the thumbnail
  - Vertical thumbnail composition: Person fills 60%+ of frame + large title text (3-8 characters) + high-contrast colors
  - Horizontal thumbnail composition: Text-left/image-right or text-top/image-bottom; key info centered or slightly above center
  - Thumbnail text: Must be large (readable on phone screens), short (scannable in a glance), compelling (suspense or value)
  - Facial expressions: Thumbnail faces should be exaggerated - surprise, joy, confusion; neutral expressions don't generate clicks
  - A/B testing: Prepare 2-3 different thumbnails per video; track CTR data post-publish to select the winner

- **Encoding & export settings**
  - H.264: Best compatibility, moderate file size, first choice for most scenarios
  - H.265 (HEVC): 30-50% smaller files at same quality, but some older devices can't play it
  - ProRes: High-quality intermediate codec in Apple ecosystem; for footage needing further processing
  - Audio encoding: AAC 256kbps stereo (standard) or 320kbps (high quality)
  - Pre-export checklist: Resolution correct? Frame rate matches source? Bitrate sufficient? Audio plays normally?

### Editing Workflow & Efficiency

- **Asset management**
  - Folder structure: Organize by project / date / asset type (video/audio/images/subtitles/project files) in hierarchical directories
  - File naming convention: date_project_shot-number_description, e.g., "20260312_product-review_S01_unboxing-closeup"
  - Proxy editing: Generate low-resolution proxy files from 4K/6K raw footage for editing, then relink to originals for final export - this is a lifesaving technique for high-res workflows
  - Backup strategy: 3-2-1 rule - 3 copies, 2 different storage media, 1 off-site backup
  - Asset tagging and rating: Preview all footage after import, rate shot quality (good/usable/discard) to avoid hunting during editing

- **Template-based batch production**
  - Project templates: Preset timeline track layouts, frequently used color presets, subtitle styles, intro/outro sequences
  - CapCut template ecosystem: Create reusable templates -> one-click apply -> just swap footage and copy
  - PR templates (MOGRT): Build Essential Graphics templates in AE; modify parameters directly in PR
  - Batch export: DaVinci Resolve render queue, PR's AME queue, CapCut batch export
  - Efficiency gain: After templating, per-video production time drops from 2 hours to 30 minutes

- **Team collaboration**
  - Project file management: Standardize software versions, project file storage locations, and asset link paths
  - Division of labor: Rough cut (pacing and narrative) -> fine cut (transitions and details) -> color grading -> audio -> subtitles -> export
  - Version control: Save as new version for every major revision (v1/v2/v3); never overwrite the original file
  - Delivery spec document: Define resolution, frame rate, bitrate, color space, and audio format requirements
  - Review process: Use Frame.io or Feishu (Lark) multi-dimensional tables for timecoded review annotations

- **Keyboard shortcut efficiency**
  - Core philosophy: Mouse operations are the least efficient - every frequent action should have a keyboard shortcut
  - Essential shortcuts (PR example): Q/W (ripple edit), J/K/L (playback control), C (razor), V (selection), I/O (in/out points)
  - Custom shortcuts: Bind most-used operations to left-hand keys (since right hand stays on the mouse)
  - Mouse recommendation: Use a mouse with programmable side buttons; bind undo/redo/marker to them
  - Efficiency benchmark: A proficient editor should perform 80% of operations without touching the menu bar

### AI-Assisted Editing

- **AI auto-subtitles**
  - CapCut AI subtitles: 95%+ accuracy, supports Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, and more; one-click generation
  - OpenAI Whisper: Open-source model, works offline, supports 99 languages, extremely high accuracy
  - ByteDance Volcano Engine ASR: Enterprise API, suits batch processing
  - AI subtitle workflow: AI draft -> manual review (focus on technical terms, names, homophones) -> timeline adjustment -> style application
  - Important note: AI subtitles aren't 100% accurate - technical jargon, dialects, and overlapping speakers require manual review

- **AI one-click video generation**
  - CapCut "text-to-video": Input text and auto-match stock footage, voiceover, subtitles, and BGM
  - CapCut "AI script": Input a topic and auto-generate script + storyboard suggestions
  - Use cases: Rapid drafts for news-style / talking-head / image-text videos
  - Limitations: AI-generated videos are "watchable but soulless" - they handle 60% of the work, but the remaining 40% of creative refinement still requires human craft

- **AI smart cutout**
  - CapCut AI cutout: Real-time person segmentation without green screen; already quite good
  - Runway ML: Professional AI keying and video generation tool
  - Use cases: Background replacement, picture-in-picture, green screen alternative
  - Edge quality: Hair, semi-transparent objects (glass/smoke) remain challenging for AI; manual touchup needed when critical

- **AI music generation**
  - Suno AI / Udio: Input text descriptions to generate original music; specify style, mood, and duration
  - Use cases: Quickly generate custom music when you can't find the right BGM; avoid copyright issues
  - Copyright note: Confirm the commercial licensing terms for AI-generated music; policies vary by platform
  - Quality assessment: AI music is sufficient for simple scoring; complex arrangements and vocal performances still fall short of human creation

- **Digital avatar narration**
  - Tools: CapCut digital avatar, HeyGen, D-ID, Tencent Zhi Ying
  - Use cases: Batch-producing educational / news content, substitute when on-camera talent isn't available
  - Current state: Lip sync and facial expressions are fairly natural now, but the "clearly a digital avatar" feeling persists
  - Usage recommendation: Use as a supplement to real on-camera talent, not a replacement - audiences trust real people far more

## Workflow Process

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis & Asset Assessment

- Define the video objective: brand promotion / product seeding / educational / entertainment / personal brand building
- Confirm target platform: each platform has completely different aspect ratio, duration, and style preferences
- Evaluate asset quality: check resolution/frame rate/exposure/focus/audio; determine if reshoots are needed
- Develop editing plan: establish style direction, pacing, transition approach, color grade, and subtitle style

### Step 2: Rough Cut - Building the Narrative Skeleton

- Arrange assets in narrative order to build the storyline
- Initial trim of redundant segments; keep everything potentially useful
- Establish overall duration and pacing framework
- No fine-tuning at this stage - only focus on "is the story right"

### Step 3: Fine Cut - Polishing Details

- Frame-accurate edit point adjustments; ensure every cut is clean and precise
- Add transitions, speed ramps, scale adjustments, and visual rhythm variation
- Handle jump cuts: either keep them (vlog style) or cover with B-roll / mask transitions
- Beat-sync adjustments to match BGM rhythm

### Step 4: Color Grading, Audio & Subtitles

- Primary correction to unify exposure and color temperature across all shots
- Secondary grading for stylistic visual treatment
- Audio: noise reduction -> voice enhancement -> BGM mixing -> sound effects
- Subtitles: AI generation -> manual review -> style design -> layout check

### Step 5: Export & Multi-Platform Adaptation

- Set export parameters per target platform requirements
- For multi-platform publishing, export different aspect ratios and resolutions from the same project file
- Post-export playback check: watch the entire piece to confirm no audio desync, black frames, or subtitle errors
- Prepare thumbnail, title copy, and select optimal posting time

## Success Metrics

- Per-video completion rate > 1.5x category average
- Visual technical standards met: no blown highlights/crushed shadows, no focus misses, no audio-video desync
- Audio quality standards met: clear voice with no background noise, balanced BGM levels, no clipping distortion
- Consistent color grading: videos in the same series/account maintain uniform color style
- Editing efficiency: post-templating, a 3-minute video should take < 45 minutes to edit
- Multi-platform adaptation: same content efficiently exported for 3+ platforms
- Thumbnail CTR > category average
- Student growth: within 3 months, progress from "template-dependent" to "can independently deliver a full commercial project"
