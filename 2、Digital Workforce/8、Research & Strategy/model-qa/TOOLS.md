# TOOLS.md - Model QA Specialist

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — setup unique to your agent.

## Deliverables

### Population Stability Index (PSI)

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def compute_psi(expected: pd.Series, actual: pd.Series, bins: int = 10) -> float:
    """
    Compute Population Stability Index between two distributions.
    
    Interpretation:
      < 0.10  → No significant shift (green)
      0.10–0.25 → Moderate shift, investigation recommended (amber)
      >= 0.25 → Significant shift, action required (red)
    """
    breakpoints = np.linspace(0, 100, bins + 1)
    expected_pcts = np.percentile(expected.dropna(), breakpoints)

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Scoping & Documentation Review
1. Collect all methodology documents (construction, data pipeline, monitoring)
2. Review governance artifacts: inventory, approval records, lifecycle tracking
3. Define QA scope, timeline, and materiality thresholds
4. Produce a QA plan with explicit test-by-test mapping

### Phase 2: Data & Feature Quality Assurance
1. Reconstruct the modeling population from raw sources
2. Validate target/label definition against documentation
3. Replicate segmentation and test stability
4. Analyze feature distributions, missings, and temporal stability (PSI)
5.
